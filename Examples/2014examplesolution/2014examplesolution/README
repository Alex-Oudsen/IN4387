1. Introduction
----------------
This ReadMe is meant for the mCRL2 of a drawbridge as presented 
in the accompanying report. This ReadMe will explain the use of 
each file and how the model may be constructed and verified using 
the given makefile.


2. Description of files
-----------------------
A short description for the file or set of files will be given.

2.1 Models
There are several model files given in the zip-archive.

Complete.mcrl2
	This model entails the complete model, but due to too many
	parallel components it is not possible to generate an lts
	file on a generic consumer high-end computer. Due to a lot
	of identical components, Complete_medium.mcrl2 was 
	constructed. This does mean, however, that this file might
	not be up-to-date in all respects and might lack some
	improvements made in files mentioned below.

Complete_medium.mcrl2 - MAIN FILE
	This is the main model used in all modeling and 
	verifications. It is based upon the Complete.mcrl2 model,
	but combines several identical components (P1, P2 = P12, 	
	etc.) and incorporates some more sensor checks. Some more
	improvements have been made as explained in the main 
	report.

Complete_medium_nothing.mcrl2
	This file is used in the verification. In this file all 
	communication is disabled so it should fail all functional
	requirements.

Complete_medium_everything.mcrl2
	This file is used in the verification. In this file all 
	actions are allowed at all times so it should fail all 
	system requirements.

2.2 Tests
The tests found in the similarly named folder are all individual
mu-calculus formulae presented in .mcf format. They are named 
after the requirements in the report. As such, requirement 2.a.ii
will translate to 2_1_2-{description}.

2.3 Makefile
This file allows us to use the 'make' program to automate various
tasks. This way, we can dispense with the mcrl2-gui.


3. How to run
-------------
3.1 Generating models
The commands 'view-medium' and 'sim-medium' call ltsview and
lpsxsim respectively on something generated from 
Complete_medium.mcrl2.


3.2 Verification
The command 'make tests' will compile Complete_medium.lps and run
all tests against that file. The everything and nothing files can
be used by changing their names to Complete_medium.mcrl2 before 
running 'make tests'.
